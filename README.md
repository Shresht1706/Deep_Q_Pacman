# 🧠 Deep Q-Learning AI Agent

Master complex environments through reinforcement learning — powered by Deep Q-Learning.

---

## 📝 Introduction

This project implements a **Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agent**, designed to interact with and learn from its environment using neural networks and the Q-learning algorithm. The model progressively improves its decision-making through trial-and-error, enabling it to tackle tasks like game playing, control systems, and optimization problems.

This notebook-based project showcases how reinforcement learning principles can be applied in Python, with real-time training and visualization of the agent’s performance.

## 🔧 Configuration

All hyperparameters such as:

- `learning_rate`
- `batch_size`
- `gamma` (discount factor)
- `epsilon` (exploration rate)
- `memory_size`

can be tuned directly within the `DeepQ.ipynb` notebook for experimentation.

## 🧠 Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- Matplotlib
- OpenAI Gym

*(Exact versions listed in `requirements.txt`.)*

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Performance can vary depending on the random seed and hyperparameter selection.
- Long training time on CPU; GPU acceleration recommended.
- Results are environment-dependent (tested primarily on [ENVIRONMENT_NAME]).
